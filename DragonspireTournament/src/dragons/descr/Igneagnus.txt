A dragon commonly employed by wizards. They are born of an igneous rock submerged 
in lava on a night of a harvest moon. They are popular among apprentices because 
they are relatively easy to create, mild mannered, and eager to please their masters. 
Badly trained specimens are known to drool magma when praised.

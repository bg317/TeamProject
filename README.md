Dragon flavor text:

Igneagnus

A dragon commonly employed by wizards. They are born of an igneous rock submerged in lava on a night of a harvest moon. They are popular among apprentices because they are relatively easy to create, mild mannered, and eager to please their masters. Badly trained specimens are known to drool magma when praised. 

Element: Fire<br/>
Attack damage Base: 5

Tenebret

This dragon emerges fully formed from ancient, undisturbed ice flows on moonless nights. It imprints on the first wizard it sees after emerging. Tenebrets have the curious trait of always being surrounded by a swirling front of frigid air; stingy wizards sometimes employ them as full-time refrigerators. 

Element: Ice<br/>
Attack damage base: 5

Galthi

Often mistaken for a familiar by regular folk, these dragons are small enough to ride on their masters’ shoulders, but no less potent than their larger counterparts. They are the protector of choice for the traveling wizard.  Galthi are born of a gecko that has ingested a rare electrical reagent called a Cloudsphere. It is commonly believed that the first Galthi was created by mistake. No one would purposely waste a Cloudsphere like that, would they?

Element: Electricity<br/>
Attack damage base: 5

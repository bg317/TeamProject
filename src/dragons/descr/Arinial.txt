Arinals are golem dragons born from chunks of ore. Arinials will eat any metal they 
are given, but rusted metals make them sick. Their carapaces will take on  the colors 
and strengths of  the metals they are fed. For the best-fortified coats, arinials should 
eat combinations of steel, wolfram, chromium, and titanium.

Often mistaken for a familiar by regular folk, these dragons are small enough to 
ride on their masters’ shoulders, but no less potent than their larger counterparts. 
They are the protector of choice for the traveling wizard. Galthi are born of a gecko 
that has ingested a rare electrical reagent called a Cloudsphere. It is commonly 
believed that the first Galthi was created by mistake. No one would purposely waste a 
Cloudsphere like that, would they?
